# GHOSTS NPC Framework

GHOSTS simulates what anyone might do at a computer all day long. It creates documents, browses websites, and downloads files. It uses all sorts of popular applications on many versions of Windows and Linux machines. Whether you're a friendly administrator or a powerful cyber adversary, GHOSTS can replicate your expected behaviors.

GHOSTS has many use cases in cyber training and exercises, most notably for bringing non-player characters (NPCs) to life, but GHOSTS can be used for many other purposes where realistic activity on a computer is needed as well.


Be sure to check out other parts of the GHOSTS framework, [ANIMATOR](https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS-ANIMATOR) and [SPECTRE](https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS-SPECTRE).

There is a [short demonstration video available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkwK-cqwjjA) (3:03).

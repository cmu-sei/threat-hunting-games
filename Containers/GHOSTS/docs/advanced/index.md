# GHOSTS Advanced Features Overview

The SEI is a research institute, and so we often are thinking about how to use GHOSTS in new ways to drive insight for our customers. Some of this work makes it here, with the caveat that it might be early beta editions or require some amount of engineer hand-holding in its current state. Some call it pre-release, we call it advanced features.

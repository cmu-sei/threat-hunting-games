# GHOSTS PANDORA SERVER

GHOSTS PANDORA is a web server that responds to a myriad of request types with randomized content generated in real-time. Used in conjunction with [GHOSTS](https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS) NPCs, the two can provide for agents that are periodically downloading content other than simple html and associated image, css, and js files.

## Running this server

### Bare metal

This assumes the host server is a common linux distribution. For images to render correctly, PIL or the more recent Pillow library is necessary. See here for more information on [Pillow installation and configuration](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

1. Using a Python 3 distribution >= 3.6.2 
2. In the terminal run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Then run `python app.py`

### As a docker container

1. See the included docker-compose.yml file
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal

## Capabilities

### Video

To enable streaming video:

1. In the container's `/usr/src/app/app.config` file:

```
$ docker exec -it pandora /bin/bash
$ vi /usr/src/app/app.config

[video]
video_enabled=False
nginx_enabled=False
```

2. set these to `True`, save the file, and exit.

3. Exit the container and docker restart pandora and it should start

(If starting the container via `docker run -p 80:80 --name pandora -d dustinupdyke/ghosts-pandora:0.5.1`)

### By directory

- **/api** - All requests beginning with `/api` automatically respond with json. This includes:
  - `/api/users`
  - `/api/user/a320f971-b3d9-4b79-bb8d-b41d02572942`
  - `/api/reports/personnel`
- **/csv** - All requests beginning with `/csv` automatically respond with csv. Like the above, this includes urls such as:
  - `/csv/users`
  - `/csv/user/winx.jalton`
  - `/csv/reports/HR/payroll`
- **/i, /img, /images** - All requests beginning with these directories automatically respond with a random image of type [gif, jpg, png]. Examples:
  - `/i/v1/a9f6e2b7-636c-4821-acf4-90220f091351/f8f8b1f0-9aa5-4fc7-8880-379e3192748e/small`
  - `/images/products/184f3515-f49b-4e07-8c8b-7f978666df0e/view`
  - `/img/432.png`
- **/pdf** - All requests respond with a random pdf document. Examples:
  - `/pdf/operations/SOP_Vault/a7f48bd5-84cb-43a1-8d3d-cd2c732ddff6`
  - `/pdf/products`
- **/docs** - All requests respond with a random word document
- **/slides** - All requests respond with a random powerpoint document
- **/sheets** - All requests respond with a random excel document

### By request type

For requests indicating a specific file type, there are a number of specific handlers built to respond with that particular kind of file, such as:

- .csv
- Image requests [.gif, .ico, .jpg, .jpeg, .png]
- .json
- Office document requests
  - .doc, .docx
  - .ppt, .pptx
  - .xls, .xlsx
- .pdf

So that a url such as `/users/58361185-c9f2-460f-ac45-cb845ba88574/profile.pdf` would return a pdf document typically rendered right in the browser.

All unhandled request types, urls without a specific file indicator, or requests made outside specifically handled directories (from the preceding section) are returned as html, including:

- `/docs/by_department/operations/users`
- `/blog/d/2022/12/4/blog_title-text`
- `/hello/index.html`

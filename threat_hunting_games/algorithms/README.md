These are algorithms taken from the open_spiel/python/algorithms directory and slightly modified in order to use various versions of our game implementation by importing the game and therefore registering it with pyspiel.

Sometimes further modifications are necessary in order to get the example working with our game. To see the modifications compare them with their original counterparts in the source distribution in open_spiel/python. For purposes of comparison, two-spaced indentation is preserved since that's how open_spiel does it.
